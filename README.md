# SortedBag

Project Description:

The Sorted Bag Data Structure and Iterator Testing project is a C++ software project that focuses on the development and thorough testing of a custom "Sorted Bag" data structure and its associated iterator. This project is designed to ensure the correctness, efficiency, and reliability of the Sorted Bag implementation and to validate the functionality of the provided iterator.

Key Components and Features:

Sorted Bag Implementation: The project includes the development of a Sorted Bag data structure capable of storing and managing elements with respect to a specified ordering relation. The Sorted Bag allows for efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements while maintaining their sorted order.

Iterator Implementation: An iterator class is provided to facilitate the traversal of elements within the Sorted Bag. The iterator enables forward iteration through the elements while ensuring they are visited in the correct order according to the sorting relation.

Relation Functions: The project includes predefined relation functions, relation2 and relation3, which specify the sorting order used by the Sorted Bag. relation2 sorts elements in ascending order, while relation3 sorts elements in descending order.

Testing Suite:

The project incorporates an extensive testing suite to ensure the correctness and robustness of the Sorted Bag and Iterator implementations. The testing suite includes the following test cases:

Creation and Initialization: Tests the creation of an empty Sorted Bag and verifies its initial state, including size and emptiness.

Add Elements: Tests the addition of elements to the Sorted Bag while maintaining the correct sorted order. Elements are added in various sequences and quantities to assess the Sorted Bag's handling of different scenarios.

Remove Elements: Tests the removal of elements from the Sorted Bag and verifies that the correct elements are removed based on the specified sorting order.

Iterator Functionality: Evaluates the functionality of the iterator by testing its ability to traverse the Sorted Bag's elements in the expected order. It checks for correctness in element retrieval and iterator validity.

Quantity and Randomized Testing: Extensive testing scenarios assess the Sorted Bag's performance when dealing with large quantities of elements and random element removals.

Add Occurrences: Tests the ability to add multiple occurrences of an element to the Sorted Bag while maintaining the correct sorting order.

Project Goals:

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

To create a reliable and efficient Sorted Bag data structure that adheres to the specified sorting relation.

To implement a functional iterator that allows for the correct traversal of elements within the Sorted Bag.

To thoroughly test the Sorted Bag and iterator to ensure correctness and performance across various scenarios.

To validate that the Sorted Bag can handle edge cases and large data sets without errors.

By successfully achieving these goals, this project provides a dependable and well-tested Sorted Bag data structure and iterator that can be integrated into other software projects requiring sorted storage and iteration of elements. Additionally, it serves as an educational example of data structure development and testing practices in C++.
